        <p>We believe that we can manage Trevyr Barn on an environmentally responsible basis, without compromising the luxury of your holiday. These are some of the measures that we have taken:</p>

      <h2>How we help the environment</h2>
        <ul class="tickBullet">
          <li>We optimized the overall energy efficiency rating when we undertook the conversion in 2008 (taking into account the age and construction of the original building).</li>
          <li>The barn is heated by an energy efficient condensing boiler, and we have fitted the latest thermostatic controls to the under floor heating downstairs and the radiators upstairs.</li>
          <li>We use ecologically responsible cleaning products wherever possible.</li>
          <li>Laundry is line dried in the orchard when the weather permits.</li>
          <li>We encourage our guests to recycle; and provide appropriate facilities.</li>
          <li>We are committed to supporting local businesses, and all the services we employ are locally based.</li>
          <li>We believe in minimising food miles and enjoying the fantastic local produce for which Monmouthshire is so well known. Our welcome pack includes a range of locally produced goodies.</li>
          <li>We are members of our local community sustainable agriculture project and have recently contributed one of our fields to grow fruit and vegetables collectively.</li>
          <li>Trevyr used to have a cider mill and our orchard has a range of traditional fruit trees which haven't seen a pesticide for years, if ever. You are welcome to help yourself to fruit in season.</li>
          <li>There is some fantastic walking and cycling to be enjoyed, and we encourage our guests to get out and enjoy the area.</li>
